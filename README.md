## Features

- Secure login (JWT)
- Employee CRUD
- Department CRUD
- Attendance tracking
- Salary management
- Reports: PDF/Excel export (employees, departments, attendance, salary)

## Layers

1. Domain: pure business entities + rules (no EF, no web, no MySQL)
2. Application: use-cases (commands/queries), validation, DTOs, interfaces
3. Infrastructure: MySQL/EF Core, repositories, file/PDF/Excel services
4. API: controllers/endpoints, auth wiring, DI, swagger
5. Frontend stays separate and talks to API over HTTP.

Why: keeps business rules independent of frameworks/UI/DB; easier testing; easier growth (bonus analytics won’t become a mess).

1. API depends on Application + Infrastructure
2. Infrastructure depends on Application
3. Application depends on Domain

POST /api/auth/login → returns JWT token
